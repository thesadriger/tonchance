# Examples

This directory contains simple examples demonstrating Botgram's API.
Some also serve as development tools.

To run an example, pass the API token as an argument:

~~~ bash
node print.js <API token>
~~~

There are also more complex (and practical) examples that are maintained
in their own repositories:

 - [**Shell bot**](https://github.com/botgram/shell-bot):
   Runs terminal commands, sends the live output and allows the user to interact.

 - [**Explode game bot**](https://github.com/botgram/explode-game-bot):
   Simple bot offering a simple 'chain reaction' HTML5 game, based on [this pen](https://codepen.io/towc/pen/BfAhe).
